# Introduction

-   The purpose of ECE 385 is to give you as sense of modular design and how to apply it to real systems to create complex structures in hardware.
-   This document will walk you through a toolkit developed to help you throughout your final project.
-   We want you to develop complex and interesting hardware and so we believe that it is more productive for you if some of the pure software components of the project are provided to you.
-   Currently, we only have PNG to Hex convert tool for you guys to use. In the future, we hope to develop more tools that will help you create increasing complex projects and show us what you can really do.
